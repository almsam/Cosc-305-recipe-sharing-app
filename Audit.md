# Cosc 305 P10 - Audit Report:

### Samira Almuallim, 62197256, 2025 WT1

## A. Introduction

This audit evaluates the progress, accuracy, and project management practices of the FitBuddy development team during Milestone 1. The main questions addressed are:

1. How accurately the team followed its charter, timeline, and Gantt chart;
2. Whether the delivered features match the video and milestone claims;
3. How effectively the team tracked risks, issues, changes, and quality metrics;
4. Whether the project is on a viable path toward its final deliverables.

When I audited the FitBuddy project, I examined documentation, milestone outputs, the demo video, and the team’s responses in the live audit meeting last Friday. This report is organized consistently across all sections: project overview, audit methodology, findings, recommendations, & conclusion
