# Cosc 305 P10 - Audit Report:

### Samira Almuallim, 62197256, 2025 WT1

## A. Introduction

This audit evaluates the progress, accuracy, and project management practices of the FitBuddy development team during Milestone 1. The main questions addressed are:

1. How accurately the team followed its charter, timeline, and Gantt chart;
2. Whether the delivered features match the video and milestone claims;
3. How effectively the team tracked risks, issues, changes, and quality metrics;
4. Whether the project is on a viable path toward its final deliverables.

When I audited the FitBuddy project, I examined documentation, milestone outputs, the demo video, and the team’s responses in the live audit meeting last Friday. This report is organized consistently across all sections: project overview, audit methodology, findings, recommendations, & conclusion

### i. Project Introduction

**Project Audited:** FitBuddy – Full-Stack Fitness Application
**Team:** L04 Alloc
**Auditor:** *Samira*

FitBuddy is a fitness companion app built with React, JavaScript (Express), & a PostgreSQL backend. It provides user authentication, dashboards for members/trainers, workout and session logging, and an early Gym Finder feature. The milestone report shows 19 deliverables, with 17 passed and 2 marked Conditional Pass (likely in progress at the time of the Audit, should be full pass as of dec 5).

### ii. Audit Process and Methodology

To conduct the audit, the following materials were reviewed:

* **Milestone Review PDF** (architecture, Gantt baseline, scope changes, deliverable status, risks n issues)
* **Demo Video** (UI flows, feature completeness vs. milestone claims)
* **GitHub Repo** (only dev branch code)
* **Smartsheet exports** (change logs, risks, issues, workload trends)

#### Audit Meeting Details:

* Attendees: FitBuddy team members & I
* Purpose: Ask interview questions. Clarify discrepancies in timeline, charter objectives, dataset changes, and feature differences between the milestone video and current build.

#### Key Meeting Questions Asked:

1. How closely the team followed the Gantt chart
2. Number and reasons for timeline changes
3. Charter objectives currently at risk
4. Any missing or unimplemented quality metrics
5. Differences between video features and the current implementation

These questions were used for validating the milestone review accuracy and assessing project management practices.
