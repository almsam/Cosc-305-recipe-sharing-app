## Readme:

The readme can be found [**HERE**](https://github.ubc.ca/samialmu/L04-SegFaults/blob/main/README.md)

## Reflection:

### Q1:

I learnt ways to reinforce lessons I have previously learnt in experiences as a project manager for organizations and teams such as OSPREY. I was able to apply concepts such as HR and personnel management, such as the concepts of team morale and the human component. I also learnt the importance of risk management in the context of project management, and how to plan for changes in scope, time, & schedule. I also  focused on the conflict resolution skills and strategies that are mandatory for any PM to have in order to ensure the success of a project.

### Q2:

The most challenging aspect of the project was creating a realistic project schedule for a specific project. During teh audit I realized I was stuck using extremely general things such as "development" and "testing" without breaking them down into smaller tasks. I feel I would have been able to do such a thing easily for a specific project I was confident with, but a project surrounding the most standard full stack system I resorted to generic things in the Gantt chart.

### Q3:

The thing I would change about the project would be a more specific project idea. This would both allow for a more realistic project schedule to be created, and also allow for more specific Gantt chart. I would also change the way the teams were organized, as I feel that having a 4th team member would have allowed for a better end product and better kinds of iterative development.
