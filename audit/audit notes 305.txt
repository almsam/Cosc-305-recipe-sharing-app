How closely is your team using the Gantt chart for weekly planning?
How many changes did you make to the gantt timeline?
	started with backend and wanted to go front.
	had to move front end up, which changed timeline


Which Proj Charter objectives are at risk, and what's being done to address them?
Are there quality metrics you planned but not yet implemented? If yes - why?
	made the gym dataset smaller, but way more detailed	

Can you clarify any discrepancies between the video features and the current implementation?
	metric page is now more detailed, section for cardio

1a. Charter & Timeline accuracy: 6/10 - challenges diverted various things
1b. Video quality compared to end product: 7/10 - better UX
1c. Milestone review accuracy: 8/10

2a. How detailed is your change log: 8/10
2b. How accurate was risk and change tracking: 9/10
2c. How extensive was quality tracking (quality metrics): [8, 8.5, 8]/10 - very small varrience in group members answers

3. How well did you respond to shareholder requests?: 10/10 - they adapted well

FITBUDDY MILESTONE
REVIEW
COSC 305 • PROJECT MILESTONE REVIEW • FREEZE DATE:
NOV 7, 2025
TEAM: ABDULLAH MUNIR • ALI HAIDER • RAAD SARKER

• Project recap and architecture
• Milestone scope and evaluation approach

AGENDA

• Deliverables status and progress over time
• Scope changes, change requests, and
movement
• Risks, issues, and team workload pulse
• Go / No-Go recommendation and lessons
learned

FITBUDDY – PROJECT RECAP
•

Full-stack fitness companion for members and trainers.

•

Core flows: signup/login, dashboards for members & trainers,
class booking, workout & progress tracking, and basic gym
discovery.

•

Target users: busy students and young professionals who want
simple, structured workouts with trainer guidance.

•

Sponsor outcome: a working prototype web app plus a short
demo video showcasing the core use cases.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE – HIGH LEVEL

• Frontend: React + Vite + React Router + Tailwind CSS.

• Backend: Node.js + Express REST APIs, organized by domain (auth, users,
workouts, sessions, gyms).
• Auth & security: JWT-based authentication, role-based access (trainer vs
member), secure cookie / local storage handling.
• Data layer: PostgreSQL-ready schema for users, workouts, exercises, sessions,
and gym metadata.
• Dev & infra: Dockerized multi-container setup (frontend + backend +
database) for consistent local development.

FROM CHARTER TO NOW – SCOPE EVOLUTION

• Original Charter (P2):
•

• Very broad feature set (workouts, nutrition, social feed, advanced analytics, admin
portal).

•

• Ambitious multi-gym & multi-role vision in a single term.

• Current Milestone Scope:
•

• Narrowed to two main personas: member and trainer, with one primary gym context.

•

• Focus on end-to-end flows (auth → dashboard → booking / tracking) instead of many
half-finished features.

•

• Added sponsor-requested client video and future Gym Finder as separate, clearly
tracked scope changes.

MILESTONE CONTEXT

• Milestone covers all deliverables from project start (Week 7) through the
freeze date (Nov 7, Week 12).
• Evaluation is based on the baseline Gantt chart saved on Nov 7 (see Appendix
– Baseline Gantt slide) with no new change requests applied during freeze.
• Scope, risks, issues, and decisions are tracked in dedicated Smartsheet sheets
and synced into Excel.
• Goal of this review: provide sponsors with a realistic view of current status,
remaining risks, and readiness for the next phase.

DEFINITIONS – PASS / CONDITIONAL / DID NOT PASS
•

•

•

Pass
•

• Deliverable is complete and meets the acceptance criteria.

•

• Code merged into main/main-like branch and demoed with no critical defects.

•

• Linked documentation (README, architecture notes, test notes) is present.

•

• Mapped to Smartsheet status = “Complete” at the freeze date.

Conditional Pass
•

• Functionality is implemented and demoable but has minor gaps (styling, small bugs, missing edge-case tests).

•

• Work may still be on a feature branch and needs review or clean-up before release.

•

• Mapped to Smartsheet status = “In Progress” (≥ 90% complete) at the freeze date.

•

• Example: Docker dev environment and database seeding – usable for us, but onboarding docs and clean-up still pending.

Did Not Pass
•

• Critical acceptance criteria not met or not usable for demo.

•

• Mapped to Smartsheet status = “Not Started” or “Blocked” at the freeze date.

•

• Not mapped to any deliverable in this milestone – all items were at least Conditional Pass or better.

EVALUATION PROCESS
• Reviewed Smartsheet % complete and statuses against actual code, UI, and
demo flows.
• Cross-checked Git commit history and pull requests, e.g., frontend design PR
“Fix: Dynamic User Name Display and Role-Based Routing” and workout/auth
PRs.
• Validated functionality with manual end-to-end runs: login → dashboard →
workout tracking → class scheduling.
• Verified backend API responses against seeded database records for users,
workouts, classes, and gyms.
• Reviewed the demo video so that milestone flows (auth → dashboard →
booking/tracking) match what the sponsor expects to see.

• Deferred: Advanced analytics dashboard moved to the next milestone.
• Added: Gym Finder MVP after sponsor discussion, tracked as Additional Feature.

KEY DECISIONS & CHANGE REQUESTS
•

Key Decisions & Change Requests

•

• 2025-10-08 – Auth Setup

•

– Decision: Use JWT-based auth with role-based routing for members vs trainers.

•

– Impact: Medium – Faster backend integration; required extra frontend work for routing.

•

• 2025-10-15 – Gym Finder MVP

•

– Decision: Add basic Gym Finder to the scope as an Additional Feature.

•

– Impact: High – Pulled some UI capacity away from analytics, but did not delay the critical path.

•

• 2025-10-22 – Dockerized Dev Environment

•

– Decision: Standardize dev setup with Docker; treat remaining polish as Conditional Pass.

•

– Impact: Medium – Short-term set-up friction but better long-term velocity.

•

Overall, change requests were controlled and tracked; none forced critical-path items beyond the
freeze date.

Risks
• 4 TRACKED RISKS: 2 HIGH IMPACT, 2 MEDIUM, 0 LOW.
• 3 RISKS REMAIN OPEN (CI/CD & BRANCHING, FE/BE
INTEGRATION, LIMITED UI POLISH).
• 1 RISK IS CLOSED (BACKEND PAUSE EARLY IN TERM –
RESOLVED ONCE TEAM ALIGNED ON TECH STACK).
KEY EXAMPLES:
• HIGH – CI/CD PIPELINE NOT READY: MITIGATED BY
MANUAL DEPLOY STEPS AND A SIMPLIFIED DOCKER
FLOW.
• HIGH – FRONTEND/BACKEND INTEGRATION DELAYS:
MITIGATED VIA EARLIER TEST ROUTES AND PAIRING
SESSIONS.
• MEDIUM – LIMITED UI POLISH: ACCEPTED FOR THIS
MILESTONE; SCHEDULED AS EXPLICIT SCOPE IN THE
NEXT PHASE.

GO / NO-GO RECOMMENDATION
•

Recommendation: GO – proceed to the next phase with a focus on polish and integration.

•

Why GO:

•

• 17/19 deliverables (≈89%) fully Passed; the remaining 2 are Conditional Pass, non-critical, and
have owners + target dates.

•

• All critical backend APIs and core frontend flows (auth, dashboards, workout tracking, basic Gym
Finder) are implemented and demoable.

•

• No high-severity risks realized; open risks are understood and tracked with mitigation steps in
place.

•

• Team workload has been sustainable, and stakeholders are prepared for the demo.

•

What to focus on next: CI/CD hardening, docs for the dev environment, and UI polish for
member/trainer dashboards.

Earlier focus on end-to-end slices (auth →
dashboard → one complete flow) would
reduce integration risk later.

LESSONS
LEARNED &
NEXT STEPS

Pair programming and clearer branching
strategy helped reduce merge-conflict risk
but should have been adopted earlier.
Using Smartsheet status + short weekly
written updates made it easier to run this
milestone review quickly.
Next steps: close the remaining Conditional
Pass items, harden testing, and refine the
UI before final client demo.

CONDITIONAL PASS DELIVERABLES

• Deliverable | % Complete | Critical Path | Owner | Target Date | Status
Update
• Set Up Database | 100% | No | Ali | Nov 15 | Fully functional; clean-up +
documentation still being polished.
• Dockerized Dev Environment | 95% | No | Raad | Nov 16 | Works for team;
onboarding docs and minor script fixes pending.
• Risk if delayed: slower onboarding for new contributors and more friction
when setting up new dev machines.

MOVEMENT OF DELIVERABLES
• Movement of Deliverables
• Moved Earlier: 1
• Moved Later Inside Milestone: 2
• Moved Outside Milestone: 1
• Archived: 0

• The item moved outside the milestone is: Advanced analytics dashboard.
• Reason: Sponsor prioritized a working Gym Finder and solid core flows over
extra analytics, so analytics moved to the next milestone.

RISK CATEGORIZATION SUMMARY

• Open Risks: 3 (CI/CD pipeline, branching strategy, FE/BE integration)
• Closed Risks: 1 (backend pause / tech stack uncertainty)
• Accepted Risks: 1 (limited UI polish for this milestone)

• Mitigated Risks: 2 (integration and CI/CD workarounds)
• Realized Risks: 0 (none turned into major production-level issues yet)
• Next steps: Reduce exposure by finishing CI/CD, tightening branching rules,
and allocating time for UI polish early in the next milestone.

ISSUE CATEGORIES AND
RESOLUTION TIME THIS
MILESTONE
•

Low severity: 0 issues

•

Medium severity: 0 issues

•

High severity: 4 issues (Dockerization, missing APIs, test failures,
routing/DB problems)

•

Average resolution time:

•

High: ~7 days

•

At freeze time, 2 High issues remain open (DB seeding edge cases
and a minor routing bug) with owners and target dates – see
Issues Overview for details.

•

Goal for next milestone: reduce average High-severity resolution
from ~7 days to 3–4 days by tightening CI and adding earlier
smoke tests

LESSONS LEARNED (MILESTONE
1)

• Earlier identification of at-risk deliverables
needed.
• Branching strategy created merge friction—
must improve.

• Testing coverage must be expanded earlier in
the milestone.
• Documentation updates should be done
incrementally.
• Risk definitions and status categories need
refining.

Hours

• Approximate total hours logged by
the team per week (Weeks 7–12).

• Interpretation: Hours ramp up as we
approach core feature deadlines
(Weeks 9–11) and drop slightly
post-freeze.
• This matches the baseline Gantt,
where most core backend +
frontend features were scheduled
to complete by early November.

EVIDENCE – PULL REQUESTS &
CODE ARTIFACTS
•

We used concrete artifacts to support the milestone
evaluation:

•

• Frontend PR “Fix: Dynamic User Name Display and
Role-Based Routing” – removed hardcoded user data,
fixed role-based redirects, and normalized backend fields
to `name`.

•

• Backend auth routes and middleware now normalize
`full_name` → `name` before responses, ensuring
consistent data for dashboards and navbars.

•

• Member and trainer dashboards/profiles now read
from context + localStorage so names and roles display
correctly after signup/login.

•

• These changes back up our claims that core auth +
dashboard flows are implemented and demoable.

BASELINE GANTT AT
FREEZE DATE (NOV 7,
2025)
•

This is the baseline Gantt used for planning
and evaluating the milestone.

•

• Freeze date: Nov 7, 2025.

•

• Core backend + frontend features (auth,
dashboards, workout tracking) were
scheduled to finish by early November.

•

• The clustering of Passed deliverables in
Weeks 10–11 aligns with these planned
completion dates.

•

• Movement of deliverables (1 earlier, 2
later, 1 outside) occurred on non-critical
items and did not extend the critical path.
