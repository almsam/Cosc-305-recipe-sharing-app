## Q1:

### Summary of each senario:


A. This senario was as standard as it gets. The project proceeded as planned with no unexpected events. This felt like a control group for the other senarios, allowing a student to focus on regular task management, resource allocation, and timeline adherence without any disruptions.

B. This senario was characterised by the rival company stealing workers through aggressive recruitment tactics, leading to a significant loss of skilled labor. The project manager had to quickly adapt by reallocating resources (outsourcing) and hiring new workers as soon as the option was avaliable. This sudden change caused delays and increased costs, as the new workers required training and supervision.

C. This senario had the management team immediately pull the deadline forward by weeks due to market pressures. This required the pm/student to go into crunch. The team had to work overtime and staffing changes were all but mandatory. Personally: I would have had zero issues if they had increased the budget to accomidate the changes as I would be happy to train the 'throw money at the problem' skill.

D. This senario seemed relatively standard. It was an excercise of dealing with a larger team then normal over anything else. This one involved a level 4 target and a bit more budget then normal.

E. This senario alos seemed to be a large volume project. I quite frankly found this one a bit boring as it was very similar to D with only minor changes in budget and team size needed

F. This senario surpises you with a mid project technical issue. This senario overall rewarded you for having prototypes that could be tested early on to reduce risk. This one also surprises you with a car crash half way through the project taking out a key team member for the time being. This one felt very realistic as unexpected personal emergencies are common in real world projects (such as a PM I was overseeing over summer having a personal emergency and needing to take time off, leading me to focus more on PM for his work & less on admining the other 2 projects). As a cherry on top this project also had moving goals and a supplier having issues delivering key components. This senario felt like the definition of "anything that can go wrong, will go wrong" and really tested adaptability and crisis management skills

G. This project consisted of a fire threatening the city. This caused my workers to step back from work due to their kids being at home. Not to mention the stress and work from home tech issues. There was also the team social dynamic issues and unexpected turnover. This senario really wrapped it all up, as I realized that from a management point of view its easy to forget that your team are humans with lives outside of work, and sometimes those lives can impact work in major ways. This senario really hammered home how easy it is to view your team as just numbers, when in reality they are people first and a PM should water their plants
