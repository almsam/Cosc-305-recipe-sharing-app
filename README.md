# Cosc 305 Recipe app - L04-SegFaults

During my undergraduate studies at UBC, I - Samira Almuallim - worked on this project as part of the Cosc 305 project management course. The project involved creating a recipe sharing web application called "Wooden Spoon". Below is an overview of the project, including team members, objectives, scope, and tech stack.

The main takeaways from this class were learning how to effectively manage a software project, work collaboratively in a team, and apply project management principles to ensure timely delivery of a functional product.

I also learnt project planning tools like Gantt mapping, timeline estimation, and more. Ultimately I am leaving this course with the confidence to manage a team of people and run a project in the way I need it to in the future.

### Project Overview & Obective

The Wooden Spoon project is a web app designed to simplify the process of uploading,
finding, & sharing recipes. Many existing recipe sites are cluttered with ads, have poor
filtering tools, and overall make browsing diPicult. Wooden Spoon offers a focused,
dynamic platform with simple roles & clean design.
Project Purpose (Objectives)

### Project Scope

Build a user-friendly recipe sharing app with upload, view, save, and interaction features.
Provide role-based access (User, Admin) to maintain platform safety and quality.
Integrate modern UX features such as filtering by ingredients, time, and diPiculty.
Deliver a functional MVP within the term, aligned with project requirements and deadlines.

### Tech Stack Summary

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (dynamic pages for recipes, profiles, etc.)
- Backend: Flask (Python), SQLite database
- Auth: Role-based access (User/Admin)
- Hosting: Heroku or Render (free/self-hosted)
- Optional: AI/LLM for recipe recommendations and summarization
