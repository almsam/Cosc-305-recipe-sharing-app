# Project Charter – Wooden Spoon Recipe Sharing Platform


### 1, Identification

Project Title: Wooden Spoon – A Modern Recipe Sharing Platform 
Team Name: L04 SegFaults
Team Members: Samira Almuallim, Estella Arnott, & Aakash Singh
Date: September 24 2025


### 2, Project Overview / Background

The Wooden Spoon project is a web app designed to simplify the process of uploading, finding, & sharing recipes. Many existing recipe sites are cluttered with ads, have poor filtering tools, and overall make browsing difficult. Wooden Spoon offers a focused, dynamic platform with simple roles & clean design.

### 3, Project Purpose (Objectives)

Build a user-friendly recipe sharing app with upload, view, save, and interaction features.
Provide role-based access (User, Admin) to maintain platform safety and quality.
Integrate modern UX features such as filtering by ingredients, time, and difficulty.
Deliver a functional MVP within the term, aligned with project requirements and deadlines.


### 4, Business Needs or Opportunities (Needs)



Centralization: Users often rely on scattered recipe blogs; Wooden Spoon provides one organized hub.

Improved UX: Reduce reliance on ad-heavy, cluttered platforms - Wooden Spoon will have no adds

Community Building: Create an accessible, ad-less environment where creators and home cooks engage directly.

Future Potential: An algorithm to recommend new recipes, as well as LLM integration



### 5, Scope



##### Functional Reqs:

User Features: Login, post recipes, browse/search, filter by ingredients/difficulty/time, & rate recipes.

Admin Features: Moderate content, manage tags, handle reports, feature or delete recipes, ban users

System Features: Role-based access, responsive UI, secure backend with SQLite database, dynamic pages (home feed, profiles, recipe detail pages, collections, admin dashboard)

Optional Features (Stretch Goals): LLM integration - AI summarization and recommendations


##### User Requirements

Easy navigation and recipe discovery.

Reliable filters for dietary needs and allergies.

Smooth uploading and editing of recipes.

Safe environment maintained by admins





### 6, Key Stakeholder Summary:


End Users/Home Cooks: Access and engage with recipes.

Recipe Creators/Bloggers: Upload and showcase content.

Admins/Moderators: Ensure quality and trust via moderation.

Project Team Members: Development and delivery of MVP.

Teaching Staff/TAs: Oversight, feedback, and assessment.



### 7, Project Milestones

 - Week 1–2: Requirements gathering, design mockups, database schema
 - Week 3–4: Backend setup (Flask n SQLite), user authentication
 - Week 5–6: Core features: recipe upload, browse/search, collections
 - Week 7: Admin tools, bug fixes, system testing
 - Week 8: Final polish, documentation, deployment, and demo



### 8, Big Deliverables/Milestones:

Design documentation and mockups

Flask + SQLite backend with authentication and data storage.

Web frontend with recipe upload and search features.

Admin dashboard with moderation tools.

Final report, demo, and project handoff.




### 9, Assumptions

Team members will contribute 5 hours per week outside of lab.
Hosting will be done via self-host or free service (e.g., Heroku, Render)
Initial user base will be small (team, TAs, limited testers)
AI tools may be used to assist development (coding, summarization) - but only with attribution


### 10, Constraints

 - 8-week timeline with limited resources.

 - Team of 3 developers with varying experience levels.

 - Limited budget for hosting and optional AI integration.

 - MVP must be live by December 5, 2025 for sign-off.
