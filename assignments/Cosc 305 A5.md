## Q1:

#### Summary of each scenario:


A. This scenario was as standard as it gets. The project proceeded as planned with no unexpected events. This felt like a control group for the other scenarios to come, allowing a student to focus on regular task management, resource allocation, and timeline adherence without any disruptions.

B. This scenario was characterized by the rival company stealing workers through aggressive recruitment tactics, leading to a significant loss of skilled labor. The project manager had to quickly adapt by reallocating resources (outsourcing) and hiring new workers as soon as the option was available. This sudden change caused delays and increased costs, as the new workers required training and supervision.

C. This scenario had the management team immediately pull the deadline forward by weeks due to market pressures. This required the pm/student to go into crunch. The team had to work overtime and staffing changes were all but mandatory. Personally: I would have had zero issues if they had increased the budget to accommodate the changes as I would be happy to train the 'throw money at the problem' skill.

D. This scenario seemed relatively standard. It was an exercise of dealing with a larger team then normal over anything else. This one involved a level 4 target and a bit more budget then normal.

E. This scenario also seemed to be a large volume project. I quite frankly found this one a bit boring as it was very similar to D with only minor changes in budget and team size needed

F. This scenario surprises you with a mid project technical issue. This scenario overall rewarded you for having prototypes that could be tested early on to reduce risk. This one also surprises you with a car crash half way through the project taking out a key team member for the time being. This one felt very realistic as unexpected personal emergencies are common in real world projects (such as a PM I was overseeing over summer having a personal emergency and needing to take time off, leading me to focus more on PM for his work & less on admiring the other 2 projects). As a cherry on top this project also had moving goals and a supplier having issues delivering key components. This scenario felt like the definition of "anything that can go wrong, will go wrong" and really tested adaptability and crisis management skills

G. This project consisted of a fire threatening the city. This caused my workers to step back from work due to their kids being at home. Not to mention the stress and work from home tech issues. There was also the team social dynamic issues and unexpected turnover. This scenario really wrapped it all up, as I realized that from a management point of view its easy to forget that your team are humans with lives outside of work, and sometimes those lives can impact work in major ways. This scenario really hammered home how easy it is to view your team as just numbers, when in reality they are people first and a PM should water their plants


## Q2:

#### 1. Which scenario did you like the most and why?

The scenario I liked the most was **Scenario G**, because it realistically captured how unpredictable real project environments can get. The combination of technical failures, personal emergencies, fire developments, and shifting project goals forced me to actively balance schedule, scope, and staffing under conditions where no single decision solved everything. It highlighted the importance of early prototyping, risk planning, and having contingency capacity. This scenario felt the closest to real project management, where multiple unrelated issues often stack together, and I found it satisfying to apply structured problem-solving under high pressure. I also enjoyed the realization of the human element. I realized that these may just be numbers, but when I hit the ground running I will be responsible for 40 hours a week of real peoples lives, and I should wield that power responsibly

#### 2. Which scenario did you like the least and why?

The scenario I liked the least was **Scenario C**, largely because of the missed opportunity to have a sudden budget increase. I ended up completely disregarding the score due to my budget as I would have been happy to forward an additional 10,000 $ tactically at the problem to meet the new deadline. Without that option, I only enjoyed and learnt from it while ignoring the parameter - thus disappointing my eye for good game design

#### 3. What did you learn through those simulations? Give concrete examples.

Across the scenarios, the biggest lesson I learned is that projects aren't just numbers - they are delicate balencing acts responsible for large services and peoples livelyhoods. For example, in Scenario G, the fire and resulting personal emergencies highlighted how external factors can drastically affect team productivity. I learned that as a project manager, I need to be empathetic and flexible, adjusting timelines and expectations when my team members face real-life challenges

I also learned how important it is to plan for uncertainty. Scenario F demonstrated that early technical testing and prototype validation can prevent small defects from turning into full project blockers. When the supplier issue appeared later in that scenario, having already validated earlier components made the problem easier to isolate and respond to

This reinforced the idea that emotional well-being, unexpected life events, and team morale directly influence schedule and output, and must be accounted for in realistic project planning. I learnt overall that when I manage my projects in the future, I need to remember that my team are humans first, and that their lives outside of work will inevitably impact their work. Therefore, I wish to build a relationship and a great culture in my workplaces, I will never assume I know what is going on in someones life outside of work, and I will always strive to water my plants so they may grow
